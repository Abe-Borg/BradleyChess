Script for Initializing Q-Tables for Chess Moves

This script initializes Q-tables for a chess-playing reinforcement learning (RL) agent. It processes a dataset of chess games to extract unique moves for both white and black pieces, and creates Q-tables with these moves as indices. The Q-tables are then saved for future use in training the RL agent.

Dependencies:
- game_settings
- pandas
- time
- numpy

Main Variables:
    chess_data_file_path: Path to the chess data pickle file.
    game_settings.CHESS_DATA: Loaded chess data stored in a DataFrame.
    white_color: Character representing white pieces.
    black_color: Character representing black pieces.

Main Execution:
    - The script is designed to be run as a standalone program.
    - It initializes Q-tables for both white and black pieces based on unique moves extracted from the chess data.
    - Measures the time taken for the initialization process.

Function Details:

def main():
    '''
    Initializes Q-tables for a chess-playing RL agent.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Loads the chess data from a pickle file specified in game_settings.
    2. Defines the characters representing white and black pieces.
    3. Generates lists of turn columns for both white and black pieces based on the maximum number of turns per player.
    4. Extracts the columns related to moves for both white and black pieces from the chess data.
    5. Flattens the arrays of moves and finds unique moves for both white and black pieces.
    6. Creates Q-tables with the unique moves as indices and turn columns, initializing all values to zero.
    7. Saves the Q-tables to specified file paths in game_settings.
    8. Logs any errors encountered during the process.
    9. Prints the total time taken for the initialization process.
